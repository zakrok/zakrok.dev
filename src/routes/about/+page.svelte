            Currently I am working at JetBrains as an intern under the WebStorm team on my JSEval plugin.
            I've got to say that this environment has been one of the most motivating ones I have ever been in. (WIP)

            As a former Software and QA engineer at Manometric, I was responsible for assuring the quality of its
            services
            by providing extensive end-to-end automatic testing as well as unit and component tests. Additionally, I
            maintained several automations within its communication systems. I worked there for two months over the

            <b>Delft Hyperloop</b> <br>
            During my time at Delft Hyperloop , as part of the Sense & Control department, I was responsible for
            developing
            the GUI for monitoring and controlling the Hyperloop pod. The process involved careful designing of the
            software
            architecture and communication with my fellow Embedded Engineers who programmed internal control of the pod.
            <br>
            <br>
            Within this context of mission critical software and its timeliness and liveness constraints, the speed and
            reactivity of the front end were vital. The GUI was built to sustain constant flow of data while also
            allowing
            for near instant control back to the running pod.

            <b>Hobbies</b> <br>
            I love skateboarding, history and bike-riding. I also find drumming quite exciting.
            Right now I am trying ot learn "Smells like Teen Spirit" by Nirvana.

            <b>Music</b> <br>
            I am a big fan of rap music, more specifically: Eminem, JPEGMAFIA and Joey Valence & Brae. Hereby,
            I include that I do not condemn or condone their political beliefs or similar, and I am only listening to
            their music.
            <br><br>
            Nevertheless, I also love metal core: Bring Me the Horizon, especially their "POSTHUMAN: SURVIVAL HORROR"
            album.
            <br><br>
            I don't know exactly what genre are Glass Animals... but I love them as well.
            <br><br>
            In case you are open to listening to Bulgarian music, definitely recommend Grigovor and Gena.

            <b>Background</b> <br>
            I was born in Burgas, Bulgaria in 2003. In school, I fell in love with math and lego. Honestly, I was
            thinking of becoming an architect... but then I played Minecraft for the first time (quite fitting). Five
            years later I tried making my own game in GameMaker Studio following the tutorials of Heartbeast. To this
            day, I remember their words (which I am going to rephrase since I don't remember them exactly):
            <br><br>
            <i>"I love programming because it let's me create my own world."</i>
            <br><br>
            These words resonated with me, and just before 8th grade I started learning web development. I started
            High-school in the Mathematical School in my city. There I learned more programming languages and algorithms,
            but I was really keen on studying myself in my free time.
            <br><br>
            After a couple of failed attempts on competitions earlier, in 11th grade I founded team Praxidike together
            with three fellow friends of mine. We won 4 competitions on local and national level, being qualified for
            the global NASA Challenge.
            <br><br>
            After finishing high school, I enrolled in the Computer Science & Engineering bachelor of TU Delft. In my
            second year there I joined the Honours Programme of the university with a GPA of 8.7. Now I am still there
            doing my masters whilst working at JetBrains and being a teaching assistant.
